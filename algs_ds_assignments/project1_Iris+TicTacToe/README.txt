Casey Richards, Project 1
Algorithms for Data Science, Spring 2021

Created with R Studio version 1.4.1130 and R version 4.0.3 on a Macbook Pro Late 2013, 10.13 Mojave

If you choose to open all scripts in R Studio, opening the project1_Iris+TicTacToe.Rproj will automatically open all the needed files.  

All necessary libraries to load are included in the files.  "Here" package was used for easy of file access, but if preferred to not use it the rest of the code will still run.  dplyr, lattice, car, and EnvStats were used in different scripts so they will need to be downloaded if not already in your R version. 

note - I did outlier removal by hand without a function and then compared to a function I wrote later, so this code is longer than would be had I written the function first

All "source" functions were originally in nested folders.  I changed this so that they will now work if all functions are in the same folders as scripts for ease.  Please let me know if there are difficulties with this, or copy and paste from function to script if desired
