Casey Richards, Project 2
Algorithms for Data Science, Spring 2021

Created with R Studio version 1.4.1130 and R version 4.0.3 on a Macbook Pro Late 2013, 10.13 Mojave

If you choose to open all scripts in R Studio, opening the R Project file will automatically open all the needed files.  

All necessary libraries to load are included in the files. Dplyr (for piping), MASS, e1071, h20, keras, and pracma were used in different scripts so they will need to be downloaded if not already in your R version. 

All "source" functions were originally in nested folders.  I changed this so that they will now work if all functions are in the same folders as scripts for ease.  Please let me know if there are difficulties with this, or copy and paste from function to script if desired
